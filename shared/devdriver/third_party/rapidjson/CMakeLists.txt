# C++ STL defines an interface for "iterator" objects. It also supplies a class,
# std::iterator that includes all of these methods to implement. This has been
# deprecated in C++17, in favor of using templates instead of inheritance.
# We disable this because we don't want to modify third party code if it can be helped.
#
# Because rapidjson is a header-only library, we cannot silence warnings in it
# Any settings here bleed into code that uses rapdijson. :(
#
# See this blog for more details about these warnings:
