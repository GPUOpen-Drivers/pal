# DevDriver RPC Protocol Registry

## About

This is a shared repository to centralize storing of protocol definitions. New protocols can be created with a PR, and
then the two or more components that want to communicate using them can both clone this repo and use [rpc-gen] to
generate client and server side code to use the DevDriver Communication libraries `ddRpc{Client,Server}`.
