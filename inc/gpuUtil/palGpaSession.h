*        (GPA).  Abstracts IPerfExperiment creation, memory management, completion confirmation, and results reporting
*        at a level convenient for GPA.  Each PAL client driver will need to publish an API extension exposing this
*        support for use by GPA.
*
* A GpaSession is a container for a set of _samples_ of performance counter and/or SQ thread trace data.  Its main
* purpose is to manage resources (IPerfExperiments and their backing system/GPU memory) in an efficient manner that is
* consistent with command buffer management in modern APIs.  Consider GpaSession as a peer of DX12's command
* allocator or Vulkan's command pool objects.
*
* Basic flow of usage:
*     - Newly create sessions are in the _reset_ state.
*     - A session is moved from the _reset_ state to the _building_ state by calling Begin().
*     - Samples are added to a session by specifying desired data for each query and marking a begin and end location
*       in ICmdBuffers as they are built.  Internally required resources, like GPU memory where counters will be
*       written, are allocated from internal pools managed by the session.
*     - A session is moved from the _building_ state to the _complete_ state by calling End().
*     - The application will submit all command buffers referenced by the session.
*     - The session is confirmed as _ready_, either using standard PAL fences to confirm all assocated submission have
*       completed, or by polling IsReady() on the session.
*     - Results for all samples in the session can be queried via GetResults().
*     - Reset() should be called once results have been gathered and before building a new session.  Resources are
*       retained by the session object for use in the newly built session.  The session object must be destroyed in
*       order to fully release all resource back to the system.
*
* Cumulative-type samples may not span multiple command buffers, as other apps could interfere with the counts and
* there the final data doesn't have time-based visibility to detect that happened.
*
* @warning GpaSession is not thread safe.  Performing samples in command buffers being built simultaneously by multiple
*          threads should use multiple GpaSession objects.
