* @brief Helper class providing a pool to efficiently manage IGPuEvent objects.
*
* A GpuEventPool is a container for a set of GPU event objects. Its main purpose is to provide client with a utility to
* efficiently manage PAL's GPU events.
*
* @warning GpuEventPool is not thread safe.  Acquire event or recycle event from different threads should use
*          different pool objects.
