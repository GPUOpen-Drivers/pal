 * Fences can be specified when calling IQueue::Submit() and will be signaled when certain prior queue operations have
 * completed.  The status of the fence can be queried by the client to determine when the GPU work of interest has
 * completed.
 *
 * Fences are guaranteed to wait for:
 * + Prior command buffer submissions.
 * + Prior queue semaphore signals and waits.
 * + Prior direct presents.
