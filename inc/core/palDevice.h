 ***********************************************************************************************************************
 * @defgroup ResourceBinding Resource Binding Model
 *
 * _Resource binding_ refers to the process of binding resources (textures, UAVs, samplers, etc.) for access by shaders
 * in a pipeline.  This is an area where 3D APIs diverge significantly.  PAL's model is designed to minimally abstract
 * the underlying hardware in a way that allows performant implementations by each client driver.
 *
 * ### Hardware User Data
 * GCN hardware has 16 _user data_ registers that act as a generic interface for passing values from a command buffer to
 * a shader.  User data registers are set to their desired value via packets in a command buffer, then the specified
 * values are loaded from the user data registers into shader GPRs when a wave is launched.  Since the user data is just
 * arbitrary generic data, this method can be used to pass any type of data a client may want to specify directly from
 * a command buffer, for example:
 *
 * - __Constant value__ - a 32-bit floating point or integer constant could be written into user data then be used
 *   directly by the shader.
 * - __Shader resource descriptor (SRD)__ - 4 or 8 dwords of consecutive data could be an SRD which will be used as a
 *   t#, s#, etc. by the shader.
 * - __Pointer__ - The user data could be an arbitrary GPU virtual address where a table of constants, SRDs, etc. are
 *   stored.
 *
 * The 3D driver and shader compiler are responsible for working together to define how resources referenced in a shader
 * should be mapped to user data bound in a command buffer.
 *
 * ### PAL User Data
 * PAL only lightly abstracts the hardware user data concept.  DeviceProperties reports the number of user data entries
 * supported on the device in maxUserDataEntries.  Note that some clients may require more user data entries than there
 * are physical user data registers - PAL will manage "spilling" of user data entries to GPU memory if necessary.
 *
 * User data entries are set in a command buffer by calling ICmdBuffer::CmdSetUserData().
 *
 * ### Shader User Data Mapping
 * When creating a pipeline, the client must specify how the user data entries set in a command buffer map to resources
 * referenced by each shader in the pipeline.  This is done in the pUserDataNodes array of PipelineShaderInfo.
 *
 * The resource mapping is built as a graph of _resource mapping nodes_ where the root nodes in the graph correspond
 * to the user data entries.  Each node fits in one of the following categories:
 *
 * - __SRD__: A 4 or 8 dword descriptor describing a shader resource.  The mapping specifies the type and slot the SRD
 *   corresponds to (e.g., UAV 3 or sampler 7).
 * - __Descriptor table pointer__: A GPU virtual address pointing at an array of other nodes.  Typically this will be a
 *   pointer to GPU memory containing just SRDs, but tables are free to be built hierarchically such that tables have
 *   pointers to other tables in them.
 * - __Inline constants__: 32-bit constants loaded directly byu the shader.  The mapping specified the CB slot that
 *   should load the constant (e.g., cb3[1]).
 * - __Unused__: A particular shader may not use all entries in a user data layout, and those should be marked unused.
 *
 * The following image illustrates a simple user data mapping:
 *
 * @image html userDataMapping.png
 *
 * ### Building Descriptor Tables
 * The client is responsible for building specifying SRDs and pointers to GPU memory in order to execute the shader
 * resource mapping specified during pipeline creation.  SRDs can be created with several methods provided by IDevice:
 *
 * - CreateTypedBufferViewSrds()
 * - CreateUntypedBufferViewSrds()
 * - CreateImageViewSrds()
 * - CreateFmaskViewSrds()
 * - CreateSamplerSrds()
 *
 * The size required for each of these SRD types is returned in the srdSizes structure in DeviceProperties.
 *
 * When building descriptor tables in GPU memory, the client will need to retrieve a virtual address of the GPU memory
 * where the tables exist in order to reference them from user data or from other descriptor tables.  IGpuMemory
 * provides the GetVirtAddr() method for this purpose.
