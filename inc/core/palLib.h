 ***********************************************************************************************************************
 * @defgroup LibInit Library Initialization and Destruction
 *
 * Before initializing PAL, it is important to make sure that the interface version is consistent with the client's
 * expectations.  The client should check @ref PAL_INTERFACE_MAJOR_VERSION to ensure the major interface version has not
 * changed since the last PAL integration.  Ideally, this should be performed with a compile-time assert comparing
 * @ref PAL_INTERFACE_MAJOR_VERSION against a client-maintained expected major version.   Minor interface version
 * changes should be backward compatible, and do not require a client change to maintain previous levels of
 * functionality.
 *
 * On startup, the client's first call to PAL must be GetPlatformSize() followed by CreatePlatform().  This function
 * gives an opportunity for PAL to perform any necessary platform-wide initialization such as opening a connection for
 * communication with the operating system and kernel mode driver or initializing tracking facilities for system memory
 * management.  CreatePlatform() returns a created IPlatform object for future interaction with PAL.
 *
 * PAL optionally allows the client to specify a set of memory management callbacks during initialization.  If
 * specified, PAL will not allocate or free any memory directly from the runtime, instead calling back to the client.
 * The client (or application, if the client forwards on the requests) may be able to implement a more efficient
 * allocation scheme.
 *
 * After a successful call to CreatePlatform(), the client should call @ref IPlatform::EnumerateDevices() in order to
 * get a list of supported devices attached to the system.  This function returns an array of @ref IDevice objects
 * which are used by the client to query properties of the devicess and eventually execute work on those devices.
 * IPlatform::EnumerateDevices() is not available to util-only clients (PAL_BUILD_CORE=0).
 *
 * The client may re-enumerate devices at any time by calling IPlatform::EnumerateDevices().  The client must make sure
 * there is no active work on any device and that all objects associated with those devices have been destroyed.
 * IPlatform::EnumerateDevices() will destroy all previously reported @ref IDevice objects and return a fresh set.
 * The client is required to re-enumerate devices when it receives a ErrorDeviceLost error from PAL.
 *
 * After enumerating devices, either during start-up or when recovering from an ErrorDeviceLost error, the client must
 * setup and finalize PAL's per-device settings.  See IDevice::GetPublicSettings(), IDevice::SetDxRuntimeData(),
 * IDevice::CommitSettingsAndInit(), and IDevice::Finalize() for details.
 *
 * After enumerating devices and finalizing them, the client may query the set of available screens. This is done by
 * calling the @ref IPlatform::GetScreens() function.  Note that screens are not available for DX clients.  Each screen
 * is accessible by zero or more of the enumerated devices. Most screens are accessible from a "main" device as well as
 * several other devices which can perform cross-display Flip presents to the screen. In some configurations, screens
 * may not be directly to any of PAL's devices, in which case fullscreen presents are unavailable to that screen. (This
 * typically only occurs in PowerExpress configurations.) Note that when IPlatform::EnumerateDevices() is called, any
 * enumerated @ref IScreen objects which existed prior to that call are invalidated for the specified platform and
 * IPlatform::GetScreens() needs to be called again to get the updated list of screens.
 *
 * On shutdown, the client should call @ref IPlatform::Destroy() to allow PAL to cleanup and free any remaining
 * platform-wide resources.  The client must ensure this call is not made until all other created objects are idle and
 * destroyed (if destroyable).
 *
 * When the client is asked to destroy a device it may call IDevice::Cleanup() to explicitly clean up the device. Some
 * clients will find it necessary to call Cleanup(), for example, if their devices have OS handles that become invalid.
 * Note that Cleanup() doesn't destroy the device; it will return to its initial state, as if it was newly enumerated.

/**
 ***********************************************************************************************************************
 * @page Build Building PAL
 *
 * Client-Integrated Builds
 * ------------------------
 * PAL is a _source deliverable_.  Clients will periodically promote PAL's source from //depot/stg/pal_prm into their
 * own tree and build a static pal.lib as part of their build process.  This process matches what is done for other
 * shared components in our driver stack such as SC, AddrLib, and VAM.
 *
 * PAL's main makefile is in .../pal/src/make/Makefile.pal.  The client is responsible for including this makefile while
 * specifying its own defs/rules to build the PAL lib in the right spot with the right options.  Here is a bare-bones
 * example of how Mantle builds PAL:
 *
 *     include $(ICD_DEPTH)/make/icddefs
 *
 *     LIB_TARGET = icdimportedpal
 *
 *     PAL_OS_BUILD      = $(ICD_OS_BUILD)
 *     PAL_SC_DIR        = SC_DIR  # Typically $(ICD_DEPTH)/imported/sc, but controlled via build variable.
 *     PAL_CLIENT_MANTLE = 1
 *
 *     include $(ICD_DEPTH)/make/Makefile.$(ICD_PLATFORM).icd
 *     include $(PAL_DEPTH)/src/make/Makefile.pal
 *
 *     include $(ICD_DEPTH)/make/icdrules
 *
 * ### Internal Pipeline Compiler Component
 *
 *  PAL is delivered alongside a module which can compile pipeline binaries in ELF format.  This module, named SCPC, is
 *  based on the AMD proprietary shader compiler (SC).  The following build options in PAL are used to control how SCPC
 *  is included in the PAL build.
 *
 *      __PAL_BUILD_SCPC__: Defaults to 1.  Controls whether or not the SCPC component is built as part of the PAL
 *      build.  Clients should only change this to zero if they are using something besides SCPC for compiling their
 *      pipeline binaries.
 *
 * ### External Shader Compiler
 * PAL must be linked with an SC library built by the client.  The client must specify the location of the SC interface
 * header files with this build parameter:
 *
 * + __PAL_SC_DIR__: Root of SC source (PAL will include headers from both the Interface and IL/inc subdirectories).
 *
 * The client is responsible for providing a version of the SC library that is compatible with PAL.  PAL will fail to
 * build if SC's major interface version isn't supported.  Since PAL handles all interaction with SC, PAL is responsible
 * for defining the SC_CLIENT_MAJOR_INTERFACE_VERSION variable on behalf of the client.  In order to facilitate this,
 * clients must include the following PAL makefile before including SC's Makefile.sc:
 *
 *     .../pal/src/make/palSpecifiedScDefs
 *
 * ### Build Options
 * The following build options control PAL's behavior, and can be set as desired by the client:
 *
 * + __Required__:
 *     - __PAL_OS_BUILD__: Set to the OS target string.  Supported targets are wNow, wNow64a, wNxt, wNxt64a, lnx, and
 *       lnx64a.
 *     - __PAL_SC_DIR__: As described above.
 * + __Optional__:
 *     - __PAL_CLOSED_SOURCE__: Defaults to 1.  Set to 0 to build only open source-able code.
 *     - __PAL_BUILD_CORE__: Defaults to 1.  Set to 0 to build only the PAL utility companion functionality (only the
 *       Util namespace will be usable).
 *     - The following build options allow specific IP support to be explicitly included or excluded:
 *         + __PAL_BUILD_GFX6__: Defaults to 1.  Set to 0 to exclude support for GFXIP 6-8.
 *         + __PAL_BUILD_OSS1__: Defaults to 1.  Set to 0 to exclude support for OSSIP 1 (i.e., DRMDMA on SI chips).
 *         + __PAL_BUILD_OSS2__: Defaults to 1.  Set to 0 to exclude support for OSSIP 2 (i.e., SDMA on CI chips).
 *         + __PAL_BUILD_OSS2_4__: Defaults to 1.  Set to 0 to exclude support for OSSIP 2.4 (i.e., SDMA on VI chips).
 *     - __PAL_BUILD_LAYERS__: Defaults to 1.  If 0, PAL will not build support for any interface shim layers.
 *       Individual layers can be either built or excluded with the following variables:
 *         + __PAL_BUILD_DBG_OVERLAY__: Defaults to 1.  The debug overlay can be enabled via a setting, and will
 *           output useful performance and debug related information on the screen while the application runs.  If 0,
 *           this support will be built out of the driver, and the setting won't do anything.
 *         + __PAL_BUILD_GPU_PROFILER__: Defaults to 1. The GpuProfiler can be enabled via a setting, and will
 *           output useful performance and debug related information to a CSV file for offline analysis. If 0, this
 *           support will be built out of the driver and the setting won't do anything.
 *     - __PAL_ENABLE_PRINTS_ASSERTS__: Enables debug printing and assertions.  Even if enabled at build time, debug
 *       prints and asserts can be filtered based on category/severity via runtime setting.  Defaults to 1 on debug
 *       builds.
 *     - __PAL_MEMTRACK__: Enables memory leak and buffer overrun tracking.  Defaults to 1 on debug builds if debug
 *       prints are also enabled.  A report of leaked memory will be printed during IPlatform::Destroy().
 *     - __PAL_DEVELOPER_BUILD__: Defaults to 0. If 1, enables developer-specific interfaces for development purposes.
 *
 * @note Some Util functionality is inline/macro based, and therefore the appropriate defines must be set when building
 *       client files that include PAL headers.  In particular, PAL_MEMTRACK and PAL_ENABLE_PRINTS_ASSERTS are used in
 *       palAssert.h and palSysMemory.h, and must match the setting used when building PAL even when included outside
 *       of the PAL library.
