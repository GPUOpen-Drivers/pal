 * @defgroup LibInit Library Initialization and Destruction
 *
 * Before initializing PAL, it is important to make sure that the interface version is consistent with the client's
 * expectations.  The client should check @ref PAL_INTERFACE_MAJOR_VERSION to ensure the major interface version has not
 * changed since the last PAL integration.  Ideally, this should be performed with a compile-time assert comparing
 * @ref PAL_INTERFACE_MAJOR_VERSION against a client-maintained expected major version.   Minor interface version
 * changes should be backward compatible, and do not require a client change to maintain previous levels of
 * functionality.
 *
 * On startup, the client's first call to PAL must be GetPlatformSize() followed by CreatePlatform().  This function
 * gives an opportunity for PAL to perform any necessary platform-wide initialization such as opening a connection for
 * communication with the operating system and kernel mode driver or initializing tracking facilities for system memory
 * management.  CreatePlatform() returns a created IPlatform object for future interaction with PAL.
 *
 * PAL optionally allows the client to specify a set of memory management callbacks during initialization.  If
 * specified, PAL will not allocate or free any memory directly from the runtime, instead calling back to the client.
 * The client (or application, if the client forwards on the requests) may be able to implement a more efficient
 * allocation scheme.
 *
 * After a successful call to CreatePlatform(), the client should call @ref IPlatform::EnumerateDevices() in order to
 * get a list of supported devices attached to the system.  This function returns an array of @ref IDevice objects
 * which are used by the client to query properties of the devicess and eventually execute work on those devices.
 * IPlatform::EnumerateDevices() is not available to util-only clients (PAL_BUILD_CORE=0).
 *
 * The client may re-enumerate devices at any time by calling IPlatform::EnumerateDevices().  The client must make sure
 * there is no active work on any device and that all objects associated with those devices have been destroyed.
 * IPlatform::EnumerateDevices() will destroy all previously reported @ref IDevice objects and return a fresh set.
 * The client is required to re-enumerate devices when it receives a ErrorDeviceLost error from PAL.
 *
 * After enumerating devices, either during start-up or when recovering from an ErrorDeviceLost error, the client must
 * setup and finalize PAL's per-device settings.  See IDevice::GetPublicSettings(), IDevice::SetDxRuntimeData(),
 * IDevice::CommitSettingsAndInit(), and IDevice::Finalize() for details.
 *
 * After enumerating devices and finalizing them, the client may query the set of available screens. This is done by
 * calling the @ref IPlatform::GetScreens() function.  Note that screens are not available for DX clients.  Each screen
 * is accessible by zero or more of the enumerated devices. Most screens are accessible from a "main" device as well as
 * several other devices which can perform cross-display Flip presents to the screen. In some configurations, screens
 * may not be directly to any of PAL's devices, in which case fullscreen presents are unavailable to that screen. (This
 * typically only occurs in PowerExpress configurations.) Note that when IPlatform::EnumerateDevices() is called, any
 * enumerated @ref IScreen objects which existed prior to that call are invalidated for the specified platform and
 * IPlatform::GetScreens() needs to be called again to get the updated list of screens.
 *
 * On shutdown, the client should call @ref IPlatform::Destroy() to allow PAL to cleanup and free any remaining
 * platform-wide resources.  The client must ensure this call is not made until all other created objects are idle and
 * destroyed (if destroyable).
 *
 * When the client is asked to destroy a device it may call IDevice::Cleanup() to explicitly clean up the device. Some
 * clients will find it necessary to call Cleanup(), for example, if their devices have OS handles that become invalid.
 * Note that Cleanup() doesn't destroy the device; it will return to its initial state, as if it was newly enumerated.
