 * @brief     Interface inherited by objects that must be explicitly destroyed by the client.
 *
 * This includes all objects except:
 *
 * + @ref IColorTargetView, @ref IDepthStencilView - These classes are treated as SRDs by the DX12 runtime.  Therefore,
 *   PAL guarantees that no action needs to be taken at Destroy() - the client should just free the memory backing these
 *   classes.
 * + @ref IDevice - These objects are created during IPlatform::EnumerateDevices() and are automatically destroyed
 *   along with the Platform object.
 * + @ref IPrivateScreen - These objects are created as during IPlatform::EnumerateDevices() based on
 *   which screens are attached to each device.  They are automatically destroyed along with the Platform object.
