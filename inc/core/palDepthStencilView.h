 * @warning IDepthStencilView does not inherit the IDestroyable interface.  PAL guarantees that no cleanup actions need

 *          never need to explicitly destroy this object.  This is a requirement for DX12, which manages depth/stencil
 *          views as a special type of descriptor, and therefore never get a chance to destroy a corresponding PAL
 *          object.
