 * Introduction
 * ------------
 * The Platform Abstraction Library (PAL) provides hardware and OS abstractions for Radeon (GCN+) user-mode 3D graphics
 * drivers.  The level of abstraction is chosen to support performant driver implementations of several APIs while
 * hiding the client from hardware and operating system details.
 *
 * PAL client drivers will have no HW-specific code; their responsibility is to translate API/DDI commands into PAL
 * commands as efficiently as possible.  This means that the client should be unaware of hardware registers, PM4
 * commands, SP3 shaders, etc.  However, PAL is an abstraction of AMD hardware only, so many things in the PAL interface
 * have an obvious correlation to hardware features.
 *
 * PAL client drivers should have little OS-specific code.  PAL and its companion utility collection provide
 * OS abstractions for almost everything a client might need, but there are some cases where this is unavoidable:
 *
 * + Handling dynamic library infrastructure.  I.e., the client has to implement DllMain() on Windows, etc.
 * + OS-specific APIs or extensions.  DX may have Windows-specific functionality in the core API, and Vulkan/Mantle may
 *   export certain OS-specific features as extensions (like for presenting contents to the screen).
 * + Single OS clients (e.g., DX) may choose to make OS-specific calls directly simply out of convenience with no down
 *   side.
 *
 *
 * The following diagram illustrates the software stack when running a 3D application with a PAL-based UMD.  Non-AMD
 * components are in gray, UMD client code is blue, AMD static libs linked into the UMD are green, and the AMD KMD
 * is in red.
 *
 * @image html swStack.png
 *
 * PAL is a relatively _thick_ abstraction layer, typically accounting for the majority of code (excluding SC) in any
 * particular UMD built on PAL.  The level of abstraction tends to be higher in areas where client APIs are similar,
 * and lower (closer to hardware) in areas where client APIs diverge significantly.  The overall philosophy is to share
 * as much code as possible without impacting client driver performance.  Our committed goal is that CPU-limited
 * performance should be within 5% of what a native solution could achieve, and GPU-limited performance should be within
 * 2%.
 *
 * PAL uses a C++ interface.  The public interface is defined in .../pal/inc, and client must _only_ include headers
 * from that directory.  The interface is spread over many header files - typically one per class - in order to clarify
 * dependencies and reduce build times.  There are two sub-directories in .../pal/inc:
 *
 * + <b>.../pal/inc/core</b>    - Defines the PAL Core (see @ref Overview).
 * + <b>.../pal/inc/gpuUtil</b> - Defines the PAL GPU Utility Collection (see @ref GpuUtilOverview).
 * + <b>.../pal/inc/util</b>    - Defines the PAL Utility Collection (see @ref UtilOverview).

 * @page Overview PAL Core Overview
 *
 * ### Introduction
 * PAL's core interface is defined in the @ref Pal namespace, and defines an object-oriented model for interacting with
 * the GPU and OS.  The interface closely resembles the Mantle, Vulkan, and DX12 APIs.  Some common features of these
 * APIs that are central to the PAL interface:
 *
 * - All shader stages, and some additional "shader adjacent" state, are glommed together into a monolithic pipeline
 *   object.
 * - Explicit, free-threaded command buffer generation.
 * - Support for multiple, asynchronous engines for executing GPU work (graphics, compute, DMA).
 * - Explicit system and GPU memory management.
 * - Flexible shader resource binding model.
 * - Explicit management of stalls, cache flushes, and compression state changes.
 *
 * However, as a common component supporting multiple APIs, the PAL interface tends to be lower level in places where
 * client APIs diverge.
 *
 * ### Settings
 * The PAL library has a number of configuration settings available for the client to modify either programmatically
 * or via external settings.  PAL also includes infrastructure for building/loading client-specific settings.
 * See @ref Settings for a detailed description of this support.
 *
 * ### Initialization
 * The first step to interacting with the PAL core is creating an IPlatform object and enumerating IDevice objects
 * representing GPUs attached to the system and, optionally, IScreen objects representing displays attached to the
 * system.  See @ref LibInit for a detailed description.
 *
 * ### System Memory Allocation
 * Clients have a lot of control over PAL's system memory allocations.  Most PAL objects require the client to provide
 * system memory; the client first calls a GetSize() method and then passes a pointer to PAL on the actual create call.
 * Further, when PAL needs to make an internal allocation, it will optionally call a client callback, which can be
 * specified on platform creation.  This callback will specify a category for the allocation, which may imply an
 * expected lifetime.
 *
 * ### Interface Classes
 * The following diagram illustrates the relationship of some key PAL interfaces and how they interact to render a
 * typical frame in a modern game.  Below that is a listing of all of PAL's interface classes, and a very brief
 * description of their purpose.  Follow the link for each interface to see detailed reference documentation.
 *
 * @image html scheduling.png
 *
 * - __OS Abstractions__
 *   + _IPlatform_: Root-level object created by clients that interact with PAL.  Mostly responsible for enumerating
 *                  devices and screens attached to the system and returning any system-wide properties.<br><br>
 *   + _IDevice_: Configurable context for querying properties of a particular GPU and interacting with it.  Acts as a
 *                factory for almost all other PAL objects.<br><br>
 *   + _IQueue_: A device has one or more _engines_ which are able to issue certain types of work.  Tahiti, for example,
 *               has 1 universal engine (supports graphics, compute, or copy commands), 2 compute engines (support
 *               compute or copy commands), and 2 DMA engines (support only copy commands).  An IQueue object is a
 *               context for submitting work on a particular engine.  This mainly takes the form of submitting command
 *               buffers and presenting images to the screen.  Work performed in a queue will be started in order, but
 *               work executed on different queues (even if the queues reference the same engine) is not guaranteed
 *               to be ordered without explicit synchronization.<br><br>
 *   + _IQueueSemaphore_: Queue semaphores can be signaled and waited on from an IQueue in order to control execution
 *                        order between queues.<br><br>
 *   + _IFence_: Used for coarse-grain CPU/GPU synchronization.  Fences can be signalled from the GPU as part of a
 *               command buffer submission on a queue, then waited on from the CPU.<br><br>
 *   + _IGpuMemory_: Represents a GPU-accessible memory allocation.  Can either be virtual (only VA allocation which
 *                   must be explicitly mapped via an IQueue operation) or physical.  Residency of physical allocations
 *                   must be managed by the client either globally for a device (IDevice::AddGpuMemoryReferences) or by
 *                   specifying allocations referenced by command buffers at submit.<br><br>
 *   + _ICmdAllocator_: GPU memory allocation pool used for backing an ICmdBuffer.  The client is free to create one
 *                      allocator per device, or one per thread to remove thread contention.<br><br>
 *   + _IScreen_: Represents a display attached to the system.  Mostly used for managing full-screen flip
 *                presents.<br><br>
 *   + _IPrivateScreen_: Represents a display that is not otherwise visible to the OS, typically a VR head mounted
 *                       display.<br><br>
 * - __Hardware IP Abstractions__
 *    + __All IP__
 *      - _ICmdBuffer_: Clients build command buffers to execute the desired work on the GPU, and submit them on a
 *                      corresponding queue.  Different types of work can be executed depending on the _queueType_ of
 *                      the command buffer (graphics work, compute work, DMA work).<br><br>
 *      - _IImage_: Images are a 1D, 2D, or 3D collection of pixels (i.e., _texture_) that can be accessed by the
 *                  GPU in various ways: texture sampling, BLT source/destination, UAV, etc.<br><br>
 *    + __GFXIP-only__
 *      - _IShader_: Container for shader byte code used as an input to pipeline creation.  No compilation occurs
 *                   until an IPipeline is created.  Currently, AMDIL is the only supported input language.<br><br>
 *      - _IPipeline_: Comprised of all shader stages (CS for compute, VS/HS/DS/GS/PS for graphics), resource mappings
 *                     describing how user data entries are to be used by the shaders, and some other fixed-function
 *                     state like depth/color formats, blend enable, MSAA enable, etc.<br><br>
 *      - _IColorTargetView_: IImage view allowing the image to be bound as a color target (i.e., RTV.).<br><br>
 *      - _IDepthStencilView_: IImage view allowing the image to be bound as a depth/stencil target (i.e., DSV).<br><br>
 *      - _IGpuEvent_: Used for fine-grained (intra-command buffer) synchronization between the CPU and GPU.  GPU
 *                     events can be set/reset from either the CPU or GPU and waited on from either.<br><br>
 *      - _IQueryPool_: Collection of query slots for tracking occlusion or pipeline stats query results.<br><br>
 *      - __Dynamic State Objects__: _IColorBlendState_, _IDepthStencilState_, _IMsaaState_, _IScissorState_,
 *                                   and _IViewportState_ define logical collections of related fixed function graphics
 *                                   state, similar to DX11.<br><br>
 *      - _IPerfExperiment_: Used for gathering performance counter and thread trace data.<br><br>
 *      - _IBorderColorPalette_: Provides a collection of indexable colors for use by samplers that clamp to an
 *                               arbitrary border color.<br><br>
 * - __Common Base Classes__
 *   + _IDestroyable_: Defines a _Destroy()_ method for the PAL interface.  Calling _Destroy()_ will release any
 *                     internally allocated resources for the object, but the client is still responsible for freeing
 *                     the system memory provided for the object.<br><br>
 *   + _IGpuMemoryBindable_: Defines a set of methods for binding GPU memory to the object.  Interfaces that inherit
 *                           _IGpuMemoryBindable_ require GPU memory in order to be used by the GPU.  The client
 *                           must query the requirements (e.g., alignment, size, heaps) and allocate/bind GPU memory
 *                           for the object.  _IGpuMemoryBindable_ inherits from _IDestroyable_.<br><br>
 *
 * ### %Format Info
 * Several helper methods are available for dealing with image formats in the @ref Formats namespace.
 *
 * ### Graphics/Compute Execution Model
 * Most graphics/compute work is defined by first binding a set of states then issuing a draw or dispatch command to
 * kick off the work.  The complete set of graphics states available in PAL is illustrated below; compute is a subset
 * of this that only includes the pipeline, user data entries, and border color palette.
 *
 * @image html stateBreakdown.jpg
 *
 * Most of these correspond directly to a PAL interface object above, and these items are bound by calling a
 * corresponding _CmdBind...()_ method in the ICmdBuffer interface.  The states marked in yellow and orange, however,
 * are _immediate_ states for which there is no object, you just specify the required state values in the corresponding
 * _CmdSet...()_ method in the ICmdBuffer interface.
 *
 * User data entries are the way that input resources are specified for the pipeline on an upcoming draw/dispatch.  This
 * mapping is complicated, and is described fully in @ref ResourceBinding.
 *
 * A final complication worth noting is that PAL provides no implicit surface synchronization.  The client is
 * respondible for explicitly inserting barriers to resolve data hazards, flush/invalidate caches, and ensure images
 * are in the proper compression state.  For more detail, see ICmdBuffer::CmdBarrier, BarrierInfo, and
 * BarrierTransition.
