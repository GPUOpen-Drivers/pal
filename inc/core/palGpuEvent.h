 * @interface IGpuEvent
 * @brief     Represents a GPU event object that can be used for finer-grain CPU/GPU and GPU/GPU synchronization than
 *            is available with IFence and IQueueSemaphore objects.
 *
 * An event object can be set or reset by both the CPU and GPU, and its status can be queried by the CPU.  This allows
 * the client to monitor progress of GPU execution within a command buffer.
 *
 * If the client knows that they will never examine an event object using the CPU they should set the gpuAccessOnly
 * flag but must take care to never call GetStatus(), Set(), or Reset().
 *
 * On creation, GPU events are in the "reset" state unless they are created with the gpuAccessOnly flag.  In that case
 * the client is responsible for placing the GPU event in a known state on first use (either "set" or "reset").
 *
 * @see IDevice::CreateEvent()
