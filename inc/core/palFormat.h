/// Library-wide namespace encapsulating all PAL entities.
namespace Pal
{

/// Specifies the format for an image or GPU memory view.
///
/// This defines the bit layout of the channels and how the value in each channel is interpreted.
///
/// Channels are listed in DX10+-style order, where the least significant channels are listed first.  For example, for
/// a uint32 val with an X8Y8Z8W8 value: X = val & 0xFF, Y = (val >> 8) & 0xFF, Z = (val >> 16) & 0xFF,
/// W = (val >> 24) & 0xFF.  Enums without a more detailed explanation can be decoded in this manner.  Multimedia,
/// or "YUV" formats are all exceptions to this rule.  Each of those formats explicitly describes how their channels are
/// organized.
///
/// Many of the multimedia (i.e., "YUV") formats are encoded such that the chrominance (chroma, CbCr, UV) samples are
/// stored at a lower resolution than the luminance (luma, Y) samples as a form of compression.  The ratio of the
/// subsampling is often referred to using an A:B:C notation, where the trio of numbers A,B,C are used to describe the
/// number of luma and chroma samples in a hypothetical region which is A pixels wide and 2 pixels high.  The three
/// numbers usually refer to the following quantities by convention:
///  A --> Width of the conceptual region of pixels, and is usually 4.
///  B --> Number of chroma samples in the first of two rows of A pixels.
///  C --> Number of changes of chroma samples between the first and second rows of A pixels.
///
/// Common examples of this notation are described below:
///  4:4:4 --> No chroma subsampling because luma and chroma both have 4 samples per row, and the number of chroma and
///            luma rows is the same.
///  4:1:1 --> Each row of 4 pixels has 1 chroma sample, and the number of chroma and luma rows is the same.
///  4:2:0 --> Each row of 4 pixels has 2 chroma samples, and there is only 1 chroma row for every 2 luma rows.
///  4:2:2 --> Each row of 4 pixels has 2 chroma samples, and the number of chroma and luma rows is the same.
///
/// Because of the subsampling ratios for multimedia formats, there are some restrictions on what dimensions can be used
/// when creating Images of these formats. 4:1:1 formats must have widths specified as a multiple of 4. 4:2:0 formats
/// must have widths and heights specified as multiples of 2. 4:2:2 formats must have widths specified as a multiple of
/// 2. 4:4:4 formats have no dimensional restrictions.
///
/// Additionally, the YUV formats are broadly grouped into two categories: packed and planar formats.  Packed formats
/// interleave the luma and chroma samples in each row of pixels.  Planar formats are organized so that all of the luma
/// samples are together, followed by all of the chroma samples.  Some planar formats interleave the U and V chroma
/// data, while some choose to have separate U and V planes.  Both packed and planar formats can have any subsampling
/// ratio between the luma and chroma data.
