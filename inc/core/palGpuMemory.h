 * @interface IGpuMemory
 * @brief     Interface representing a GPU-accessible memory allocation.
 *
 * Depending on creation parameters, this could correspond to:
 *
 * + A _real_ memory object, corresponding directly to a physical allocation made on this device (whether it resides in
 *   a local or non-local heap).
 * + A _virtual_ memory object, only consisting of virtual address space that can be mapped on a page basis to pages in
 *   _real_ memory objects via IQueue::RemapVirtualMemoryPages.
 * + Pinned memory, a _real_ memory object created by pinning down client system memory.
 * + Peer memory, a _real_ memory object corresponding to GPU memory that is likely local to another GPU.  Only copy
 *   operations (peer-to-peer transfers) are allowed with this memory.
 * + Opened/shared memory, a _real_ memory object that is fully shared between multiple GPUs, residing in a non-local
 *   heap.
 * + External shared memory, a _real_ memory object that was created by an external process and is fully shared between
 *   multiple GPUs.
 *
 * @see IDevice::CreateGpuMemory
 * @see IDevice::CreatePinnedGpuMemory
 * @see IDevice::OpenSharedGpuMemory
 * @see IDevice::OpenPeerGpuMemory
 * @see IDevice::OpenExternalSharedGpuMemory
 *
 *
 * All of these kinds of GPU memory are assigned a set of fundemental properties specified in GpuMemoryDesc which are
 * either specified by the client or by PAL.  There are specific rules these properties must follow; those rules are
 * documented here to avoid duplication.  Violating these rules will cause the device's corresponding "get size"
 * functions to return an error code, the create/open functions may not validate their arguments.
 *
 *
 * With the exception of external memory objects being opened, PAL will adjust size and base alignments as necessary
 * to meet device requirements. Typically this means going out to OS page boundaries. The client is no longer required
*  to query device requirements and align for PAL.
 *
 * Note that the device alignment requirements apply equally to GPU VAs.  However, other kinds of alignment
 * restrictions (e.g., IGpuMemoryBindable's requirements) may only apply to one of those two properties.  When creating
 * GPU memory objects the client must be careful to set the "alignment" field to the alignment of the GPU VA.
 *
 *
 * Second, the client can't directly specify a memory object's GPU VA but must specify its VA range, limiting which
 * portions of the VA space can be used.  Note that non-external shared and peer GPU memory objects will use the
 * original memory's VA range.  External shared GPU memory always uses the default VA range.
 *
 * The ShadowDescriptorTable VA range is special because it pairs the shadow GPU memory to an existing descriptor GPU
 * memory.  The client must specify the GPU VA of the corresponding DescriptorTable memory when creating a shadow GPU
 * memory object via descrVirtAddr; it must satisfy the alignment requirements of the shadow GPU memory.  Both GPU
 * memory objects must be created on the same device.  Note that descrVirtAddr can be offset into the descriptor
 * allocation such that multiple shadow GPU memory objects correspond to one larger descriptor GPU memory object.
 *
 *
 * The client can further influence the GPU VA of shared and peer GPU memory objects. If the globalGpuVa flag is set
 * when the original GPU memory object is created, PAL will assign any shared or peer GPU memory objects that same VA.
 * Note that globalGpuVa is only supported if globalGpuVaSupport is set in DeviceProperties.
