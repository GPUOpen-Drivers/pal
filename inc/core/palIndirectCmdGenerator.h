 * @interface IIndirectCmdGenerator
 * @brief     Translates an application-specified pseudo command buffer into a format compatible with AMD GPU's.
 *
 * An indirect command generator is used to permit client applications to generate their own "command buffers" using
 * the GPU.  The client's pseudo command buffers must adhere to a format which is illustrated by the structures listed
 * in this header.  This interface describes an object which is capable of taking these pseudo-commands and generating
 * a command buffer which can be executed on an AMD GPU.
 *
 * This feature essentially allows the client to support a more-flexible version of DrawIndirect which allows changing
 * the index buffer binding and/or user data entries between draws or dispatches.
