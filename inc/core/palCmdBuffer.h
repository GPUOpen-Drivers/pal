/// Hierarchical stencil (HiS) allows work to be discarded by the stencil test at tile rate in certain cases.
/// In order to use HiS, the client will define a set of pretests that will be performed whenever a particular stencil
/// buffer is written.  The stencil image will track the results of the pretest for each 8x8 tile, keeping a record of
/// whether any pixel in the tile "may-pass" or "may-fail" the specified pretest.  When stencil testing is enabled,
/// the hardware may be able to discard whole tiles early based on what it can glean from the HiS pretest states.
///
/// Each stencil image has two pretest slots per mip level.  Pretest slots are reset when an initialization barrier
/// targets their mip level on the stencil plane.  The client can then pass this struct to @ref CmdUpdateHiSPretests
/// to bind one or more valid pretests.  It is legal to bind a pretest over a reset slot at any point.
///
/// @warning Except in special cases, it is illegal to bind a pretest on top of an existing pretest.
///
/// It is only legal to bind a new pretest on top of an existing pretest if:
/// 1. All array slices within the given mip have been reset using an initialization barrier.
/// 2. The client guarantees that they will rewrite all stencil values in all array slices within the given mip
///    before the next draw with stencil testing enabled by doing either:
///      a. One or more calls to @ref CmdClearDepthStencil.
///      b. One or more draws with the stencil test disabled and stencil writes enabled.
///
/// Once pretests are selected via @ref CmdUpdateHiSPretests the client should keep track of which tests were enabled
/// on each stencil image and provide them to every call to @ref CmdClearDepthStencil.  This is optional but PAL will
/// not be able to generate HiS optimized clears unless it is given the current pretests.
///
/// @warning The pretests provided to @ref CmdUpdateHiSPretests are applied to all mips of all subresource ranges.
///          If the client varies pretests between mips they must guarantee that the given pretests were bound to all
///          mips in the given subresource ranges.
///
/// This feature works best if the future stencil test behavior is known, either directly told via an API extension
/// or via an app profile in the client layer. For example, if the application 1) clears stencil, 2) does a pass to
/// write stencil, 3) then does a final pass that masks rendering based on the stencil value being > 0, ideally we
/// would choose a pretest of func=Greater, mask=0xFF, and value=0 so that #2 would update the stencil image with
/// per-tile data that lets #3 be accelerated at maximum effeciency.
///
/// In absence of app-specific knowledge, the following algorithm may be a good generic approach:
/// 1. When the stencil image is cleared, set pretest #0 to func=Equal, mask=0xFF, and value set to the clear value.
/// 2. On the first draw with stencil writes enabled, set pretest #1 with the mask set to the app's current stencil
///    mask, and
///      a. If the stencil op is INC or DEC, set func=GreaterEqual and value the same as in #1.
///      b. If the stencil op is REPLACE, set func=Equal and set value to the app's current stencil ref value.
///
