 *          to be taken for this object.  Clients should simply free the system memory allocated for this object, and
 *          never need to explicitly destroy this object.  This is a requirement for DX12, which manages render target
 *          views as a special type of descriptor, and therefore never get a chance to destroy a corresponding PAL
 *          object.
