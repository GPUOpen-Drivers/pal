 ***********************************************************************************************************************
 * @brief Templated hash map container.
 *
 * This container is meant for storing elements of an arbitrary (but uniform) key/value type.  Supported operations:
 *
 * - Searching
 * - Insertion
 * - Deletion
 * - Iteration
 *
 * HashFunc is a functor for hashing keys.  Built-in choices for HashFunc are:
 *
 * - DefaultHashFunc: Good choice when the key is a pointer.
 * - JenkinsHashFunc: Good choice when the key is arbitrary binary data.
 * - StringJenkinsHashFunc: Good choice when the key is a C-style string.
 *
 * EqualFunc is a functor for comparing keys.  Built-in choices for EqualFunc are:
 *
 * - DefaultEqualFunc: Determines keys are equal by bitwise comparison.
 * - StringEqualFunc: Treats keys as a char* and compares them as C-style strings.
 *
 * @warning This class is not thread-safe for Insert, FindAllocate, Erase, or iteration!
 * @warning Init() must be called before using this container. Begin() and Reset() can be safely called before
 *          initialization and Begin() will always return an iterator that points to null.
 *
 * For more details please refer to @ref HashBase.
