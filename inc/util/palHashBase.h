 ***********************************************************************************************************************
 * @brief Templated base class for HashMap and HashSet, supporting the ability to store, find, and remove entries.
 *
 * The hash container has a fixed number of buckets.  These buckets contain a growable number of entry groups.  Each
 * entry group contains a fixed number of entries and a pointer to the next entry group in the bucket.
 *
 * The following restrictions are made in order to tune it to the desired usage:
 *
 * - The item must be significantly smaller than a cache line.
 * - The key must be POD-style type.
 *
 * This class aims to be very efficient when looking up the key and storing small attached items is the primary concern.
 * It's therefore not desired to have the key associated with a pointer to the attached data, because the attached data
 * may be of similar or smaller size than the pointer anyway, it would also introduce much unnecessary memory
 * management, and it would imply a minimum of two cache misses in the typical lookup case.
 *
 * The idea is that these entry groups can be exactly the size of a cache line, so an entry group can be scanned with
 * only a single cache miss.  This extends the load factor that the hash-map can manage before performance begins to
 * degrade.  For the very small items that we expect, this should be a significant advantage; we expect one cache miss
 * pretty much always, so packing the items together would not be a significant gain, and the cost in memory usage is
 * (relatively) small.
 *
 * The initial hash container will use up about (buckets * GroupSize) bytes.
