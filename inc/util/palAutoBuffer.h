/**
 ***********************************************************************************************************************
 * @brief Safe version of C99's variable-length arrays.
 *
 * The general idea is that this class encapsulates a variable-length array where we expect the size required to not
 * exceed the 'defaultCapacity' template parameter most of the time.  In those "normal" cases, this buffer will
 * reference a static array of size 'defaultCapacity', but if the constructor's parameter exceeds defaultCapacity, then
 * a dynamic array will be allocated from the heap to satisfy the space requirements.  The destructor will clean-up any
 * dynamic allocation made by the constructor.
 *
 * This class violates several PAL coding conventions, but for good reason:
 *
 * - We have overloaded the [] (array-element-accessor) operator to make using this class just like using a regular
 *   array, which it semantically represents.
 * - In order to return array elements by-reference instead of by-value, we need to use C++ references in the
 *   overloaded operators because this is required by C++.
 *
 * This class __does not__ clear the contents of the static or dynamic arrays, for performance reasons.  If a client
 * needs the buffer to be cleared, it must do the memset itself.  (However, if 'Item' is a class type rather than
 * plain-old-data, the default c'tor will be invoked.)
