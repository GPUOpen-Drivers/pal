 ***********************************************************************************************************************
 * @page UtilOverview Utility Collection
 *
 * In addition to its GPU-specific core functionality, PAL provides a lot of generic, OS-abstracted software utilities
 * in the @ref Util namespace.  The PAL core relies on these utilities, but they are also available for use by its
 * clients.  In fact, it is possible to build and use PAL only for its utility collection by building PAL with the
 * PAL_BUILD_CORE build option set to 0.
 *
 * All available PAL utilities are defined in the @ref Util namespace, and are briefly summarized below.  See the
 * Reference topics for more detailed information on specific classes, enums, etc.
 *
 * ### System Memory Management
 * palSysMemory.h defines a handful of macros that can be used for allocating and freeing system heap memory.  These
 * macros will use the client-specified allocation callbacks specified by the client at CreatePlatform() if specified.
 * These macros are:
 *
 * - PAL_MALLOC: Equivalent to malloc().
 * - PAL_CALLOC: Equivalent to calloc().
 * - PAL_FREE: Equivalent to free().
 * - PAL_SAFE_FREE: Equivalent to free(), then nulls out the specified pointer.
 * - PAL_NEW: Equivalent to C++ new.
 * - PAL_NEW_ARRAY: Equivalent to C++ new[].
 * - PAL_PLACEMENT_NEW: Equivalent to C++ placement new.
 * - PAL_DELETE: Equivalent to C++ delete.
 * - PAL_DELETE_THIS: Special version of PAL_DELETE that effectively does "delete this;"  This is necessary for
 *   classes that have non-public destructors.
 * - PAL_DELETE_ARRAY: Equivalent to C++ delete[].
 * - PAL_SAFE_DELETE_ARRAY: Equivalent to C++ delete, then nulls out the specified pointer.
 * - PAL_SAFE_DELETE: Equivalent to C++ delete[], then nulls out the specified pointer.
 *
 * ### Allocators
 * All of the memory management macros take in a templated allocator, which is required to have the following two
 * functions defined:
 *
 *     void* Alloc(const Util::AllocInfo)
 *     void  Free(const Util::FreeInfo)
 *
 * It is expected that clients that specify their own allocators will handle cases that require specific alignments
 * and/or zeroing the returned memory.
 *
 * Some allocators can be created for use by clients:
 * - VirtualLinearAllocator: A linear allocator that allocates virtual memory and backs it with physical memory
 *   when needed.
 *
 * ### Debug Prints and Asserts
 * palDbgPrint.h and palAssert.h provide a number of macros used widely by the PAL core and also available for use
 * by clients.
 *
 * The PAL_DPF, PAL_DPINFO, PAL_DPERROR, and PAL_DPWARN can be used to issue debug prints.  These macros will be nulled
 * out if PAL_ENABLE_PRINTS_ASSERTS is not defined to be 1.  SetDbgPrintMode() can be called to configure how the
 * different categories of debug prints will be handled (e.g., print to the debugger, print to file, etc.).
 *
 * The PAL_ASSERT and PAL_ALERT macros can be used to verify expected states of the program at runtime.  PAL_ASSERT
 * should be used for verifying expected invariants and assumptions, while PAL_ALERT should be used to alert the
 * developer of a condition that is allowed, but not typically expected (i.e., failure of a system memory allocation).
 * Note that the polarity of the condition check is different between assert and alert.  Asserts "assert" that the
 * specified condition is true (and complain if it's not), while alerts "alert" a developer if an unexpected condition
 * is true.  These macros will be nulled out if PAL_ENABLE_PRINTS_ASSERTS is not defined to be 1.  EnableAssertMode()
 * can be called to enable/disable asserts or alerts at runtime.
 *
 * ### Generic Containers
 * Util includes a number of generic container data structure implementations.  Note that most of these are broken up
 * into two header files - for example, list.h and listImpl.h.  The intention is that list.h will be included from
 * other header files that need a full list definition, while listImpl.h will be included by .cpp files that actually
 * interact with the list.  This should keep build times down versus putting all implementations directly in list.h.
 * - AutoBuffer: Allows dynamic arrays to be placed on the stack without a heap allocation in situations where a
 *   maximum reasonable expected size is known.
 * - Deque: Double ended queue.
 * - HashMap: Fast map implementation.  Note that this implementation has some non-standard restrictions on the key
 *   (can't be 0) and value size (must fit in a cache line).
 * - HashSet: Fast set implementation.  Note the similar restrictions to HashMap.
 * - IntervalTree: [Interval tree] implementation.
 * - RingBuffer: A ringed buffer of variable length and size.
 *
 * ### Multithreading and Synchronization
 * Util includes a number of OS-abstracted multithreading and CPU synchronization constructs:
 *
 * - Thread
 * - Mutex
 * - Semaphore
 * - ConditionVariable
 * - Event
 *
 * ### Files
 * The File class provides an OS-abstracted interface for opening files and reading/writing data in those files.
 * Further, the ElfReadContext and ElfWriteContext classes provide functionality for reading and writing buffers in the
 * [Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)]
 * The ELF utilities can be used in conjunction with File in order to read/write ELF files on disk.
 *
 * ### Inline Functions
 * palInlineFuncs.h defines a bunch of simple inline functions that are used throughout PAL and might be useful to
 * clients.  Some examples include VoidPtrInc(), Pow2Pad(), Min(), Max(), Strncpy(), etc.
 *
 * palMath.h defines a Math namespace with various constants and functions related to floating point conversions and
 * basic math rouintes like Sqrt().
 *
 * Additionally, palHashLiteralString.h defines a template metaprogramming string hash implementation that can produce
 * a FNV1A hash for a string specified in the source code without the string showing up in a compiled release build.
 *
 * ### System Utilities
 * palSysUtil.h defines a few functions providing abstracted system-specific functionality:
 * - Access to the high resolution CPU performance counters with GetPerfFrequency() and GetPerfCpuTime().
 * - Support for asynchronously querying if a particular keyboard key is currently pressed with IsKeyPressed().
 *
 * ### Cryptographic Algorithm Implementations
 * Util provides the crypto algorithm Md5
