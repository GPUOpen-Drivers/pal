pal_include_guard(PalOverridesGpu)

# These are options that override PAL subproject options related to GPUs/Asics.  As these overrides are managed and force
# set by PAL, mark_as_advanced is used to hide them from the CMake GUI. These are placed in a different file from the rest of
# the override logic for several reasons:
#
# 1.) Better version control history over gpu overrides
# 2.) Simplifies the logic
# 3.) Makes it clear where GPU cmake changes go.
# 4.) GPU overrides are a particular AMD exclusive problem, it isn't a regular problem most projects have to deal with.
#     And having a file focused on the issue helps.
