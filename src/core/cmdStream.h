// The CmdStream class manages a single stream of hardware commands on behalf of a command buffer.

// In the simplest case, the command stream will consist of a single command buffer chunk, but the CmdStream also
// supports growing a command stream with multiple chained chunks.
//
// The CmdStream does not understand actual hardware commands, it just hands out space.  It implements shared
// functionality between command buffers that use different hardware command formats (e.g., PM4 vs. SDMA).  Derived
// classes may understand hardware commands if necessary.
//
// A single command buffer could have multiple command streams (e.g., draw and compute engine streams for a universal
// command buffer).
//
// In addition to divvying out command space, the command stream can also provide space for temporary data that needs
// to be GPU-accessible during the execution of the command stream.  Command space is issued from the beginning of the
// chunk, embedded data space is issued from the end of the chunk, and a new chunk is needed when they meet.
