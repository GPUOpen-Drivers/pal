// In addition to the internal scratch ring requirement mentioned above, GFX6+ hardware also requires several internal
// memory rings for various other needs (such as Geometry Shaders or Tessellation). Like with the scratch rings, these
// others can also be dynamically resized based on the highest ring memory needs of any Compute or Graphics Pipeline
// which has been created thus far. Furthermore, some hardware has a bug which doesn't restore the state of certain
// registers after a power-managment event. Thus, a pair of small command streams may need to be submitted along with
// any client submission which follows a resize event, power-managment event, or context-switch between applications.
// This class is responsible for guaranteeing that the state of the internal memory rings and non-restored registers
// are valid before launching GPU work.
