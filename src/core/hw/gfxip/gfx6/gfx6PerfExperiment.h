// Perf experiments must manage three types of data:
// - Global counters, also called legacy counters. 32 or 64 bit counters we manually read from registers.
// - SPM counters, also called streaming perf monitors. 16 or 32 bit counters automatically streamed to a ring buffer.
// - Thread traces, which stream shader instruction details to memory.
//
//
// SPM counters are implemented between the RLC and the measuring blocks. The measuring blocks instantiate one or more
// perfmon counter modules, each controlled by a pair of PERFCOUNTER#_SELECT/1 registers. Each module contains a pair
// of 32-bit SPM delta counters, each 32-bit counter can be configured as a single 32-bit counter or two independent
// 16-bit counters. Each 32-bit counter has a single wire back to the RLC. When the RLC sends a sample signal the
// counters latch to their current value and send it over the wire one bit at a time from bit 0 to bit 31. The counters
// repeat the same 32-bit value once every 32 clocks until the sampling is complete. Each individual instance of each
// block has its own select registers and perfmon modules so in theory every counter in every instance could be running
// a unique counter event at the same time.
//
// The RLC defines a few independent SPM sampling modules: one for global counters and one for each shader engine.
// Each sampling module contains a 256-bit counter staging register, a mux select ram, and writes to its own ring
// buffer. Every 16 cycles, 256 bits are read from the muxsel ram, giving the RLC 16 16-bit mux selects. Each select
// identifies a single input wire from a specific block instance and 32-bit perfmon counter. 16 bits are deserialzed
// from each of the 16 wires to fill the 256-bit staging register with 16 16-bit counter values; the 256-bit register
// is then written to memory. Each 256-bit portion of the ring and muxsel ram is called a segment. Note that the RLC
// reads in a segment in 16 clocks but it takes 32 clocks for each 32-bit perfmon counter to repeat its value. This
// means the RLC can only read from any 32-bit counter's lower 16 bits during "even" segments and can only read from
// the upper 16 bits during "odd" segments. The RLC must always read and write segments in an "even odd even odd..."
// pattern; if we have more of one type of counter than the other we must pad the muxsel ram with "don't care" selects.
// The last segment in the muxsel ram can be even or odd, there is no requirement that it be balanced.

// The perfmon block defines a counter module that other blocks must import to support the generic global counter and
// streaming counter functionality. Each counter is controlled by two select registers that can configure the whole
// counter as either a 64-bit global counter, two 32-bit SPM counters, or four 16-bit SPM counters. All blocks should
// duplicate this module exactly so we can use the CB registers as a template for all blocks.

// There are a wide variety of different legacy SELECT registers with varying field sizes and missing fields which
// makes it very difficult to pick one register for LegacySelect. The PA_SC registers have the largest PERF_SEL field
