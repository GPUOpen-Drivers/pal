// The structures in this file represent "images" of PM4 needed either for command buffer preambles or for the queue
// context preambles. Register writes are grouped into sets based on sequential register addresses, so that the amount
// of PM4 space needed by setting several registers in each packet is minimized.
//
// In all structures, spaceNeeded is the command space needed in DWORDs. It must always be last in the structure to not
// interfere w/ the actual commands contained within.
//
// Command buffer preambles are executed at the beginning of each command buffer and cannot be skipped. They contain
// necessary state that must be reset between consecutive command buffers.
//
// Queue context preambles are executed once before a chain of command buffers are run. The queue context preamble can
// be skipped if the client (UMD) hasn't changed between submits. The queue context preamble contains necessary state
// that must be set to known values before all subsequent command buffers can be executed, but it only needs to be set
// once (in case another client [UMD] has modified it).
